          Marissa Mayer's career in technology is proof of what can be
          accomplished with invention, tenacity, and a dedication to quality.
          She has become an inspiration for me and aspiring female technologists
          all around the world because of her ability to smash barriers and
          succeed in a male-dominated industry.

            <p class="pb-2">
              Marissa Ann Mayer was born on May 30, 1975, In Wausau, Wisconsin.
              She showed a remarkable ability for maths and science from a young
              age. She attended Stanford University because of her love of
              technology, where she majored in Symbolic Systems and eventually
              received a Master of Science in Computer Science.

            <p class="pb-2">
              Mayer's career truly took off at Google, where she joined as the
              organization's first female engineer. During her 13-year tenure,
              she not only played a critical role in improving Google's user
              experience but also helped shape the way we search and interact
              with information online. Her quote,
              <cite
                >"Innovation that happens from the bottom up tends to be chaotic
                but smart,"
              </cite>
              her belief in empowering teams to drive innovation organically.

              Yahoo and the CEO Position:
            </h4>

            <p class="pb-2">
              Marissa Mayer took on a new task as President and CEO of Yahoo, a
              faltering internet behemoth in need of resurgence, in 2012. Her
              leadership and strategic vision revitalised the organisation.
              Yahoo underwent a metamorphosis under her leadership, as she
              worked relentlessly to acquire new businesses like Tumblr and
              build partnerships that revived the brand.

            <p class="pb-2">
              Mayer founded Lumi Labs with former colleague Enrique Munoz Torres
              after leaving Yahoo! in 2017. The Palo Alto-based startup focuses
              on artificial intelligence and consumer media. On November 18,
              2020, Mayer announced the rebranding of Lumi Labs as Sunshine, as
              well as the release of its first product, Sunshine Contacts.
              Sunshine Contacts claims to improve users' iPhone and Google
              contacts by leveraging clever algorithms, contact data, public
              sources, and other resources.
